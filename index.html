    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>My name is Mary Graham.  I am a rare Atlanta native, and have lived in
      Atlanta most of my life.  I currently live in Chamblee with my husband,
      Luis, and our cat, Charlie.  We both currently work at Anis Café and
      Bistro, the French restaurant where we met.</p><p>After twenty years in
      the restaurant business, I’ve recently returned to school to study
      computer programming.  I am a third-year student at Mercer, and my major
      is Software Application Development and Human Computer Interaction.  I am
      looking forward to learning about Web Development in this class!</p>

    <h3>Websites I Like:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://garnishandgather.com/" target="_blank">Garnish and Gather:</a>  I find Garnish and Gather's website visually pleasing and calming.  The color scheme and photos are inviting and make shopping here enjoyable.  The site is not full of unnecessary clutter (which drives me crazy).  It is easy to navigate; everything you need is easily found either in the banner at the top or in the footer.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.greenpan.us/" target="_blank">The Green Pan:</a>  I love the Green Pan website.  As with the site above, it’s not too “busy” and full of unnecessary clutter.  They use whitespace well, together with excellent photos.  It’s also super-easy to navigate.  Everything in the header is useful, including recipes!  Once you click on “shop,” you can easily narrow your search by number of pieces, size, price, material, heat source, etc., which keeps you from having to plow through endless items to find what you want.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.delta.com/" target="_blank">Delta Airlines:</a>  I find Delta’s website to be very easy to use.  First, it’s not full of unnecessary clutter, like on Expedia’s site, which is full of ads and popups that distract me from my task.  They keep their color scheme throughout the site, using “blue space” well.  One of my favorite features is the “Flexible Dates” option, which brings up a calendar that shows how pricing can change if you tweak your trip dates slightly.  It’s also easy to add on filters like “Non-stop flights” to narrow your search appropriately.</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Websites I Don't Like:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://menucoverman.com/" target="_blank">Menucoverman:</a>  This site is an easy example of the type of clutter that drives me crazy.  It feels like I’m at a giant yard sale.  Not only does it overwhelm me visually, it’s also hard to navigate.  I shop here frequently for work, and even though I’m a regular customer, I always find it hard to find the products I usually buy.  I have to scroll and scroll...  They don’t have any “login” or “Order History” to help me quickly find products I’ve bought in the past.</li>
        <li><a href="https://therecipecritic.com/" target="_blank">The Recipe Critic:</a> I love downloading recipes, and so many recipes on this site look wonderful.  I realize it’s how she pays for her blog, but the number of advertisements and popups on this site make me CRAZY!  I’m constantly having to click out of something to get to the information I want.  I hate clutter, and all of the ads make it really hard for me to focus on what I’m doing.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.thedump.com/" target="_blank">The Dump:</a> It can be fun to shop for furniture at The Dump, but I’m not a fan of their website.  All of the images on the homepage are too large, so I find myself scrolling and scrolling.  It feels like one large commercial, yelling discounts at me.  The font is so large on the “About Us” page that I feel like I’m in a used car commercial.  (The site does get better, however, once you start searching for specific items and are able to narrow your search down.)</li>
