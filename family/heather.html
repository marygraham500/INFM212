      <h3>About Heather Beck</h3>
      <img src="images/heatherfamily.jpg" alt="Heather's Family">
      <p>My stepsister, Heather, and her wife, Jamie, currently live in Singapore.  Heather, formerly a school superintendent in Oregon, moved their family to Singapore to
become the head of a Canadian International School.  They have enjoyed the beauty of Singapore and the ease of traveling on that side of the world, but
they also look forward to retiring in Florida when they return to the US.  They were lucky enough to inherit two of our other siblings and their spouses as
houseguests for most of 2020, when our siblings became stranded as the pandemic erupted and borders closed.  Those houseguests stayed with them for six months!</p>
      <p>Heather has a grown son, Edward, who just had a baby in December (my first great-neice, Eliana)!  Edward, and his wife, Johana, live in Kansas.</p>
