Home

Although I am biologically an only child, the remarriages of my parents brought me into quite a large family.  Through my eight 
step-siblings, I now have fifteen nieces and nephews, one great-niece, and one great nephew.  With so many people, 
it’s rare to have everyone in the same place at the same time.  (On my dad's side, just my parents, siblings, in-laws, children, and 
grandchildren total 33 people.)  I have siblings who live in China, Singapore, New Zealand, Vermont, North Carolina, and Washington State.  
Nieces and nephews all over the country, too.  We just have to take advantage of any opportunities that arise to see as many relatives as possible, 
when we can.

Childhood

I was born in 1979 to Jack and Jeannie Graham.  My father was a Presbyterian minister and my mother was an English teacher.  They divorced 
when I was two years old, so I don’t have any memories of them being married.  However, they always remained good friends, and never spoke 
badly of the other.  I primarily lived with my mom growing up, but I visited my dad twice a week.  Although I later gained many step-siblings
through their remarriages, those siblings were much older than I was, enabling me to still grow up as an only child.

When I was six years old, my father remarried.  My new stepmother, Helen Graham, had six children, all much older than I.  She had given birth 
to two children of her own, and then had adopted four more when her best friends passed away, leaving their four children behind.  Helen and her 
first husband divorced shortly after the adoption, and she ended up raising those six children on her own.  

When Helen and my father told me they were getting married, and explained that I would have a "stepmother," my reaction was to suspiciously ask, 
“Have you ever heard of Cinderella?”  Apparently I was skeptical about this new arrangement, so I agreed to come to the wedding, but stated that 
I would not smile.  As you can see in the photo, I was true to my word.  (I'm the youngest, front and center.)

When I was fourteen, my mom remarried.  My stepfather, Carl Franklin, had two children of his own, so I gained two more step-siblings.  As with 
the others, his children were years older than I was and had already left home for college.  Therefore I continued to grow up primarily as an only 
child, except for the holidays when the house filled with people.

Luis and Mary

Luis and I met at the French restaurant where we have both worked for the past 15 years, and we were friends for years before we even began to date.  
We got married in 2016, and will be celebrating our fifth anniversary this week.  He grew up in Mexico and immigrated to the united states, so 
his whole family still lives in Mexico.  We were planning to travel to Mexico this year for me to meet them, until Covid hit.

Jack and Helen

My father and my stepmother, Helen, live here in Atlanta, and we see them often (pre-Covid).  My dad was originally a Presbyterian minister, but 
25 years ago he became a psychotherapist.  Helen was also a psychotherapist until she retired this past year.  They love traveling all over the 
world to visit their children and grandchildren.  They can't wait for the pandemic to be over, so they can resume their travels!

Mom and Carl
 
My mother and my stepfather, Carl, live in Black Mountain, NC, a small town outside of Asheville.  Luis and I visit several times a year.  Both PhD's, 
my mom taught English and Carl taught Physics for 25 years, before retiring to NC to "retire."  Once in NC, they bought a bookstore, which served as
a "retirement career" for the next 20 years until they closed the bookstore this past New Year's Eve. Now they've spent their first real year of
retirement stuck at home because of the pandemic.   

When there is no pandemic, we look forward to a yearly trip with Mom, Carl, his daughter, Robin, and her wife, Cathy.  The four of us take a 
family trip every summer to a new spot the mountains, where we spend a relaxing weekend together.

Shef

My stepbrother, Shef, and his wife, Sandra, live in New Zealand.  They moved there right after they married, over 25 years ago.  They are both 
professors, and have no intention of returning to the US to live.  They have three grown children, Julia, Laura, and Alec, all of whom were born in 
New Zealand.  Julia got married in July (our second family Covid wedding), and gave birth to my brother's first grandchild (my 
first great-nephew), Eli!

Shawn

My stepsister, Shawn, and her wife, Lena, live here in Atlanta.  Shawn works as a software programmer, and Lena works at Emory and Georgia
Tech as a biomedical engineer.  While in the middle of an extensive home renovation, they have spent the majority of the pandemic quarantined
safely at their cabin in Blue Ridge, GA. Their babies are their sweet puppies!

Heather

My stepsister, Heather, and her wife, Jamie, currently live in Singapore.  Heather, formerly a school superintendent, moved their family to Singapore to
become the head of a Canadian International School.  They have enjoyed the beauty of Singapore and the ease of traveling on that side of the world, but 
they also look forward to retiring in Florida when they return to the US.  They were lucky enough to inherit two of our other siblings and spouses as 
houseguests, when our siblings became stranded as the pandemic erupted and borders closed.  Those houseguests stayed with them for six months!  

Heather has a grown son, Edward, who just had a baby in December (my first great-neice, Eliana)!  Edward, and his wife, Johana, live in Kansas.

Heidi

My stepsister, Heidi, and her husband, Greg, currently live in Vancouver, WA.  They have two grown children, Nikki and Tommy.  Nikki is a librarian
in Iowa, and Tommy is a computer programmer in NC.  Heidi and Greg had been happily living and teaching in Guangzhou, China, before the pandemic.  
Heidi's twin, and her husband, Scott, were there, too, living in the same building and teaching at the same school.  Unfortunately, they had just 
left for the Lunar New Year when the pandemic erupted and China closed its borders.  They ended up heading to Singapore, where they lived with our
sister, Heather, for the next 6 months.  When their Singapore visas ran out, borders had not yet reopened, so they were forced to return to the US.  
Now they are living in Washington State with Greg's father, searching for work overseas.

Heidi's son, Tommy, got married in May--our first family Covid wedding!

Holly

My stepsister, Holly, and her new husband, Scott, currently live in Guangzhou, China.  Holly has three grown children from her first marriage:  
Benjamin, Haylie, and Candler, and three step-children from her new marriage.  She got remarried two years ago, and after their marriage, she and 
Scott moved to China to be near Heidi and Greg, and teach in the same school where they were working. Unfortunately, they had just 
left for the Lunar New Year when the pandemic erupted and China closed its borders.  They ended up heading to Singapore, where they lived with our
sister, Heather, for the next 6 months.  When their Singapore visas ran out, borders had not yet reopened, so they were forced to search for somewhere
else to land.  They were granted entry to South Korea, where they quarantined until China reopened its borders.

Holly's son, Benjamin, just got married in December--our third family Covid wedding!

Bill

My stepbrother, Bill, and his wife, Cecilia, just moved to Atlanta this past summer.  They had been living in Colorado for the past 20 years, but 
moved here to be near our aging parents.  They have two children, Mason and Audrey, who are in high school and middle school.  Bill works from home as a 
computer programmer, and Cecilia is a CEO for Equifax.  They miss skiing in Colorado, but are working hard to put down roots here in Atlanta.  The
pandemic has made that difficult.

My stepsister, Robin, and her wife, Cathy, live in Durham, NC.  Robin is a schoolteacher, and Cathy works in Chemical Safety for UNC and Duke.  They

Chris

My stepbrother, Chris, and his wife, MidiAna, live in rural Vermont on a farm.  They have four children:  Indigo, Wisteria, Colt, and Cozy.  They 
lived in China for many years, and adopted Colt while they were living there.  He is deaf, so the whole family has learned sign-language.  Chris 
and MidiAna still teach English remotely to Chinese students for a living.  We don't see or hear from them often.
