            <img class="floatright" src="images/heidifamily.jpg" alt="Heidi's Family">
            <p class="floatleft">My stepsister, Heidi, and her husband, Greg, currently live in Vancouver, WA.  They have two grown children, Nikki and Tommy.  Nikki is a librarian
in Iowa, and Tommy is a computer programmer in NC, where he lives with his wife, Stephanie.  Heidi and Greg had been happily living and teaching in Guangzhou, China, before the pandemic.
Heidi's twin, Holly, and her husband, Scott, were there, too, living in the same building and teaching at the same school.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, they had all just
left for the Lunar New Year when the pandemic erupted and China closed its borders.  They ended up heading to Singapore, where they lived with our
sister, Heather, for the next 6 months.  When their Singapore visas ran out, borders had not yet reopened, so they were forced to return to the US.
Now they are living in Washington State with Greg's father, searching for work overseas.  It sounds like they may be moving to Bangkok, Thailand in the near future.  Heidi's son, Tommy, got married in May--our first family Covid wedding!</p>
