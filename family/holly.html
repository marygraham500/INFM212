      <h3>About Holly Rogers</h3>
      <img src="images/hollyfamily.jpg" alt="Holly's Family">
      <p>My stepsister, Holly, and her new husband, Scott, currently live in Guangzhou, China.  Holly has three grown children from her first marriage,
Benjamin, Haylie, and Candler, and three step-children from her new marriage.  She got remarried two years ago, and after their marriage, she and
Scott moved to China to be near Heidi and Greg, and teach in the same school where they were working. Unfortunately, they had all just
left for the Lunar New Year when the pandemic erupted and China closed its borders.  They ended up heading to Singapore, where they lived with our
sister, Heather, for the next 6 months.  When their Singapore visas ran out, borders had not yet reopened, so they were forced to search for somewhere
else to land.  They were granted entry to South Korea, where they quarantined until China reopened its borders.</p>
      <p>Holly's son, Benjamin, just got married in December--our third family Covid wedding!</p>
